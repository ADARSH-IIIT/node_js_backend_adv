basically cpu , that chip 

that do alu 
kya krna hai instruction like hote h like mov etc etc in assembly lang 
all concept of embeeded system design 

how cpu , ram etc communicatie how things work 






rule 

1 cpu mein , 1 time pe sirf 1 instruction , more over 1 process , more over 1 application run kr sakti hai 


cores ====> yehi wo cheez hai jo instruction / process run krti hai 


eg
1 cpu ===> 8 cores 
===> 8 diff  process/application/instruvtion can run at a time inthose 8 cores 
but har ek core mein ek time pe sirf ek process run kregi 




1 time pe 1 core mien ek process ======> concurrency 

1 time pe multiple core pe diff process ka run krna ==> parallelism 



Concurrency
Multiple processes (or threads) are in progress at the same time, but not actually running at the exact same instant — the CPU switches rapidly between them.	
On a single-core CPU, you open a browser and a music player — the OS switches between them so fast you feel both are running.



Parallelism	
Multiple processes (or threads) are literally running at the same exact time on multiple CPU cores.	
On a quad-core CPU, one core plays music while another runs your browser — both actually execute simultaneously.



cores are main thing 


mre no of cores more no of application can run ata time 










let say i have 10 application running , each take 10 mins to get completely executed 

case 1 
single core cpu
with the help o context switching , all appliation are running paralley , but one app is running in cpu only at a time 
total time for execution of all process ====> 10*10 = 100 minutes 



case 2 
4 core cpu
now we have 4 core 
means at any point of time 
we have 4 process running in a cpu 
4 process running ata instant in cpu 

it means time reduces by 4 time 
25 min only 

yahan bhi context switching hogi , because no of core < total running process 
but as we have more core , more process run a time 








there is 2 thing 
context switching ke karan aisa lgta hai ki , multi process run kr rhi 
wo kr bhi rhi hoti hain , but ek single instance of time mein cpu ke 1 core mein sirf el process hai 


multi core 
means now multiple process running at same time in diff cores
