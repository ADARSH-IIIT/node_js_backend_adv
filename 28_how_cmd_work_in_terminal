command   adarsh

           ./adarsh 

1st one is cmd 
another is we are ttrying to execute a file 



how command works in terminal 



s1 ===> it checks is it a alias that is loaded in terminal 

s2 ===>  it checks is it a loaded function 



s3  =====> it checks is it in hash , we will know what is it 


s4 ====>  then it thinks okay it is a executable file , that exist in out system 
now it will search this in system 
but only in those path that out PATH env holds seperated by : 




we have runn  testing.txt 
              ./testing.txt

in 2nd case we are trying to execute a file exist in same folder    that      . dor is vimp  

in 1st one 

first it is her any alias like 

alias testing.txt=ls

or 
myfun()testing.txt{
 .... 
}


then it cjecks in has h






as by name hash means hashing 

if it has previously found that file in any of path var pats it saves it in hash map , so that it dont need to re search again 

if not found it saerch testing.txt executable file in all apth of PATH var 
if found then it will run it 








imp cmds 



hash ====> to see all hashed locations , previous ly found 





type  cmd 

returns type of cmd alias function , executable or what 



which file.txt

it will return it exist in which PATH var path 

inthat location we will find the executable of current commd
