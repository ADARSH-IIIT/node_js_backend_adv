diff btw  a.txt   and ./a.txt




there is vimp and large diffff



when we type  


a.txt in terminal 'it treat it as command to execute 


when we type   ./a.txt 


it tries to execute a file named a.txt that exist in same folder 





both are so difff 



./a.txt  if this file has permission to execute it will execute this 



a.txt 

check is it a alias --> fun --> hash ----> any executable file in path written PATH var only 

let say a.txt exist in . current folder 


but not in any folder of path contained var 


if we write 

a.txt 
if it not a alias , fun , hash or if it not exiat in any of folder specified in path var , then it say  a.txt command not found 



./a.txt tries to execute a fie named a.txt present in sam folde
