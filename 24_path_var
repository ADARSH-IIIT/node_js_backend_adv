if we want to create a new env var 
permananrt


we should write 


export varname=100
in any bashrc file and load it using source 


echo $varname    in terminal 
in child process like node js we have process.env.varname



now if any var name like PATH HOME  already exist 
then it si not mandatory to use export 


PATH=newval
HOME=newval
will our work 
we can just update the path 







to add any new path 



PATH=$PATH:/new/path/location:new/path2 
like this in any bashrc file 


in any bashrc or in terminal access env var using $varname

this will update path var 



exact use of path var we will know when we read about how terminal run a command 


for now remember , PATH= : : : 
holds multiple path seperated by color :
