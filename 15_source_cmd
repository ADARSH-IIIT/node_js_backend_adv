it has 2 work 



1st
we write 
source new_bashfile_absolute_location.bashrc  
in outr ,bashrc of /home/adarsh 
when ever termianl opens this /home/adarsh/.bashrc file get automatically loaded 

if in that file we write    source new.bashrc , it loads this file in that termianl also internally 




2nd
let say we have updated our any of bashrc file .bashrc or any file linked with .bashrc 
on the spot terminal is not updated 
we need to kill and reat terminal 
to avoid this 

we can run 

source .bashrc 

or source new.bashrc

this will refresh the terminaal internally
