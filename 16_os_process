âœ… What is an Operating System (OS)?
An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an interface between a computer's hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources, provides essential services, and enables application software to run.

| **1. Process Management**        | Manages running programs (processes), handles multitasking, prioritization, and scheduling.   |
| **2. Memory Management**         | Allocates and tracks memory use for processes. Ensures efficient and safe use of RAM.         |
| **3. File System Management**    | Manages storage, directories, file access, permissions, and organization.                     |
| **4. Device Management**         | Interfaces with hardware like printers, disks, keyboards through drivers.                     |
| **5. User Interface**            | Provides CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface) for user interaction. |
| **6. Security & Access Control** | Manages user authentication and protects data from unauthorized access.                       |
| **7. Networking**                | Enables communication between devices and across networks.                                    |




when ever our system starts 


sabse pehle os ram mein load ho jata hai and cpu ka bhi use krta hai  , then os help krta hai new application and processes ko memory and cpu allocation mein 
os need both ram and cpu 

âœ… If Your CPU Has a Single Core, How Do the OS and Processes Run?
ðŸ”¹ Short Answer:
They run one at a time, and the Operating System uses context switching to rapidly alternate between itself and other processes on the single CPU core.



âœ… What is Context Switching in an Operating System?
Context Switching is the process by which the CPU switches from running one process (or thread) to another. It's essential for multitasking, especially on systems with a single-core CPU, where only one process can run at a time.

basicaly , 1 process mein 1 core of cpu mein bahutbaar in out krti h 
boht kam kam time ke liye but bahut jyada baar cpu mein jati aati h and instruction execute krti h 
so that it looks like multi tasking 
multiple app ek core mein aise hi run krte hai

âœ… What is a Process in an Operating System?
A process is an instance of a program that is being executed

jab a program or application run rne lgta hai 
it need memoery for its var , and other instant needed data 
and it need cpu for execution of instruction written in program 

process need both cpu and memory for execution 

any rask we do in comp is a collection of so many processes
