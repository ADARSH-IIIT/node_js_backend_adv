backend mein api keys ko hard code na krke hum parent process ke env mein set kr dete hain 




when a process runs , it needs so many data that is stored in env var 


eg 


terminal 
terminal ek process hai
iske bhi env var hotte honge 




to see env var of terminal we can write 
env 
in terminal 
it will give all key val pair of env variable 


what are there use 
there are 2 vimp env var of terminal 
PATH
HOME



home stores location of logged in user 
/home/adarsh ===> after this everything i mine 
PATH ====> vimp var , when ever we write any file name like abcd.exe 
first it checkes is it a cmd , alias , function , or hashed 
then it thinks it will be a executable file that is placed in pour comp
instead of searching it in whole comp 
it searches for all location in path var 
we will see this in deatil in 2-3 pages later
