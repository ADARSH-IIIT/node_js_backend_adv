env var 


they holds some data that will exist in our computer , they exist when that process runs 

let say when we deploy our server in vercel they ask for env var 



they set those env var for termianl that runs node server.js 


terminal is parent rocess 
node server.js is child process 
as child process can acess , env var of parent , we access imp api keys etc etc that are env vsr of terminal and use them in our code 



in js 
here is a object that holds all data related to the node js process 

process.env holds all env var 
process.argv holds arguamnrts 





if we change any env var in child it wont change in parent 
because all env var are inherited , copy 







var1=900
export var2=1000


theere is a node js script that pronts process.env.var1 , process.env.var2

output null 1000 
becuse a is a normal var , they wont be passed inside child 
even if we change process.env.b = 900000
it reain same in that terminal
