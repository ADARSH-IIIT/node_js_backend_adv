in ssh terminal we dont have vscode , we have to write and edit files in terminal itself 




cat file.js    ///   read and pritn file conttn in teminal 


to pus ha ny content in file 

echo your contet her > file.txt 


for proper editing we can use nano and vim editor 

nano

nano first.txt



vim

vi file.txt
